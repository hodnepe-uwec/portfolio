            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a graphic communications student at the Unviversity of Wisconsin Eau Claire. My designs tend to lean towards a more illustrative and cartoony style, however, I shift my focus towards simple typography from time to time. My interests lie in design having to do with the film industry but I also like creating my own original artworks. I am currently working in event production, but I want to brind more of a focus to the graphic design elements of my career</p>
